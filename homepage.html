  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessiblity:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Web Accessiblity is the practice of making a website accessible for people who need to surf the Web using alternative methods.
    </strong></p>
    <p>These methods could range from: 
      <ul>
      <li>Captions on a video</li>
      <li>Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Speech</li>
      <li>Screen Readers/Magnifiers</li>
      <li>High Contrast Elements</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Web Accessiblity has been standardized using the <cite>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</cite> This is a collaborative community which aims to develop standards for all aspects of web development. Standards like this are important to ensure that everyone has an efficient and smooth experience when browsing the web.</p>
