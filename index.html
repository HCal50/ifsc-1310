  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is the practice of working from the ground up when building a Web Page. When someone uses this method, they prioritize the content of the page above all else. Only then do they add style and functionality to make sure that the web page works universally. This practice is crucial in making sure all Web Pages are efficient and usable across any browser or device.</p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>I asked my parents to go through the SpaceX Project and provide any feedback about their user experience. The main element that negatively affected their experience was the heavy contrast between colors on the pages, and how some images didn't adhere to the page borders. To fix these problems, I heavily reviewed my CSS and found that there were missing margin conditions, causing the awkward image formatting. I also changed my color scheme to more cohesive, and less-harsh colors. </p>
    <p>What I learned the most from this project and the whole semester was the importance of optimization and how to divide up the workload from building a website. Before starting this class, I never realized the amount of work that goes into a Website. From the code itself, to all of the industry standards that go into the web page, Web Development is clearly a daunting task. But I think I adapted well and caught onto the concepts presented fairly quickly. However, I did lag behind when it came to actually applying this new knowledge and becoming proficient at it. If I could go back to the beginning of the year, I would find more resources that would allow me to practice HTML, CSS, and other concepts presented in class.</p>
  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessiblity:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Web Accessiblity is the practice of making a website accessible for people who need to surf the Web using alternative methods.
    </strong></p>
    <p>These methods could range from:</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>Captions on a video</li>
      <li>Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Speech</li>
      <li>Screen Readers/Magnifiers</li>
      <li>High Contrast Elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Web Accessiblity has been standardized using the <cite>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</cite> This is a collaborative community which aims to develop standards for all aspects of web development. Standards like this are important to ensure that everyone has an efficient and smooth experience when browsing the web.</p>
